# TikTok Typing Challenge Game
#
# HOW TO PLAY:
# 1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
# 2. Install the required libraries by running: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 3. IMPORTANT: This script requires FFmpeg to be installed on your system.
#    You can download it from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
# 4. Change the TIKTOK_USERNAME variable below to your TikTok @username.
# 5. To change the game mode, modify the `game.game_mode` variable in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block.
#    Available modes: "classic", "sentence", "emoji", "hard", "speed_up".
# 6. Run the script while you are LIVE on TikTok: python main.py
# 7. The game will start, and viewers can type the words in the chat to score points.
